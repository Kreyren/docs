# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why switch to Mod Loader Pro?

If you are a player, Mod Loader Pro loads mods faster, allows you to update mods automatically<sup>1</sup> (for mods that support it), allows you to login into NexusMods, requires minimum input to update the Mod Loader Pro and has a beautifully crafted interface matching My Summer Car's interface.

If you are a modder, Mod Loader Pro offers a very flexible environment for your new mods - an advanced, extensive and easy to use API, that lets you create any mod - from simple "Hello, World!", to a brand new vehicles. Mod Loader API is continuously being expanded and with each update it only gets better!

## If I switch to Mod Loader Pro, do I loose anything?

Absolutely not! Your game save is left untouched and in almost all cases, your mods, mod progress and configs will be still there, untouched.

## Will my mods work?

Absolutely most, if not all! Only in some very rare cases, mod may not be compatible,.

Also, mods such as [Tangerine FZ-120](https://www.nexusmods.com/mysummercar/mods/176) or [Modern Optimization Plugin](https://www.nexusmods.com/mysummercar/mods/146) have been updated to Mod Loader Pro, in order to fully utilise new features that Mod Loader Pro offers.

## Where do I place the mods, how do I install them?

If you're familiar with MSCLoader you'll find that it's eerily similar, you download whatever mods you'd like, then you extract or copy them over to the Mods-folder. By default in Mod Loader Pro, the Mods-folder is located in the game folder next to the game's executable.

After you've found the Mods-folder, please refer to each mod's description for more instructions on how to install that particular mod.

Through Steam you can access that folder by right-clicking My Summer Car in the Library, press Properties, go to the Local Files section and press Browse, and Steam will open the game folder in the explorer. You'll then find the Mods-folder there.

## Do I have to do anything while moving from MSCLoader to Mod Loader Pro?

Nope! Mod Loader Pro Installer does everything for you and configure itself automatically.

## Windows Defender detected the Installer as a virus

It is caused by the fact that Installer is a new piece of software and is not recognised by basically any anti virus software.

This is a false positive and there is nothing to be worried about.

## What is CoolUpdater.exe?

CoolUpdater acts as a middle-man between My Summer Car and NexusMods or GitHub. Because My Summer Car uses a very outdated version of Unity engine, it doesn't support modern network security protocols. CoolUpdater gets around that by doing all external communication - it downloads mod data from NexusMods, downloads mod updates and so on.

## How is my NexusMods API key stored?

NexusMods API is **ONLY** used to communicate with NexusMods itself and is stored encrypted right on your computer.

## Does Mod Loader Pro know my password to NexusMods?

No, Mod Loader Pro uses NexusMods Single Sign-On (SSO). It is NexusMods that handles all the authentication.

## Do I have to pay for Mod Loader Pro?

**NO.** Mod Loader Pro is a free software and always will be. What you may have to pay for is for NexusMods Premium membership, if you want mods downloaded from NexusMods to update automatically - this is due to the NexusMods policy.

You don't need NexusMods subscription, if mod is being hosted on GitHub, or if you are updating Mod Loader Pro itself.

## I am stuck on "Now Loading Mods in 1995..." screen

This is very likely caused by [Modern Optimization Plugin](https://www.nexusmods.com/mysummercar/mods/146). Please update it first.

If you are not using MOP, [consider reporting an issue](https://github.com/MSCLoaderPro/MSCModLoaderPro/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D).

*<sup>1</sup> May require NexusMods Premium subscription.*
